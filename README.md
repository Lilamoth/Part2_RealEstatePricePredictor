 Real Estate Price Prediction App

## Project Overview
This repository contains two projects:
**Real Estate Price Prediction App**: An app that predicts real estate prices using a neural network built with Brain.js, taking various property features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and age of the property to predict its price.

## Features & Technologies Used

### Real Estate Price Prediction App:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Machine Learning**: Brain.js (for neural network)
- **Styling**: Bootstrap (or Tailwind, depending on your choice)
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js or Recharts
- **Persistent Storage**: LocalStorage or IndexedDB
- **Deployment**: Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages

## How to Run Locally
### Real Estate Price Prediction App:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lilamoth/Part2_RealEstatePricePredictor.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd Part2_RealEstatePricePredictor
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the App**: Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Features Implemented

### Self-Driving Car Tutorial:
- **Autonomous Driving**: The car can navigate through the environment using machine learning techniques.
- **Sensor Integration**: The car makes decisions based on inputs from virtual sensors or camera feeds.

### Real Estate Price Prediction App:
- **Data Input Form**: Users can enter property details (area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and age of the property).
- **Neural Network Model**: A simple neural network is trained using Brain.js, which predicts property prices based on the user input.
- **Data Visualization**: The app displays a comparison between predicted prices and actual prices using Chart.js.
- **Persistent Model Storage**: The trained model is stored in LocalStorage or IndexedDB, allowing users to reuse the model without retraining.
- **Responsive UI**: The app is styled using Bootstrap and is fully responsive across different devices.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling for invalid inputs and failed predictions.

## Technologies Used

### Real Estate Price Prediction App:
- **React.js** for building the user interface.
- **Brain.js** for the neural network model.
- **Chart.js or Recharts** for data visualization.
- **Bootstrap CSS** for styling.

## Data Collection & Preprocessing

### Real Estate Price Prediction App:
A real estate dataset (real_estate_dataset.xlsx) was used for training the neural network. Data was preprocessed by normalizing values (min-max scaling) to ensure accurate predictions.

## Deployment

The app is deployed using GitHub Pages. You can access the live version of the Real Estate Price Prediction App here.
